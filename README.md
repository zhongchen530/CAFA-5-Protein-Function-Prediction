# CAFA-5-Protein-Function-Prediction

In this project, I take the task to predict the function of a protein given its DNA sequence. The function of a protein is represented by a Gene Ontology anotation, and a DNA sequence is given in fasta format. This is a multi-label classification problem with nearly 40000 non-exlcusive labels (the GO terms).
